# Stress-Strain-Curve-in-SHPB
It is a simple code which will give you the Stress-Strain Curve(True and Engineering both) from strain gage voltage data in a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar experiment on a non-compressible specimen.

Steps to get the Stress Strain Curve:
1. Feed the strain gage data into the code when prompted.
2. Feed in the setup specifications when asked like Excitation Voltage, Length of Specimen, Sampling rate etc.
3. Select Incident, Reflected and Transmitted Waves in the voltage data. (Be careful while selecting the starting point of each wave. Avoid selecting a small portion of opposite sign in the begining of the wave.
4. You have your Graphs!
